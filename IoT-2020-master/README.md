### Concept
This project is part of an assignment for the course of MECHENG709 for the University of Auckland. The aim is to build a Virtual Environmental Station based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simulates some sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Rain Height, Wind Direction and Wind Intensity) generating random values in several ways and sending them to a database, AWS DynamoDB, with an MQTT broker. Then these data will be shown on a simple web application (running in localhost for this project).
This project draws inspiration from the project https://www.hackster.io/gianmarcozizzo/aws-based-iot-virtual-environmental-station-4ccb71

The environmental data are generated by a Python script.
You can find the script at virtual_stations/environmental_station_simulator.py
Also make changes to django_web/views.py where appropriate for the connection to the dynamoDB database.

To run this program, complete all the steps required and input the run commands into the terminal. All three terminals need to be running for the web dashboard to be working.
The AWS CLI may need to be re-copy-pasted depending if an error relating to security is thrown in the terminal when connecting to the dynamoDB.
